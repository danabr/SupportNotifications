Security considerations
------------------------
SupportNotifications uses a master password to encrypt your data on disk.
However, after you have logged in with the master password, all credentials
are available in clear text in the extensions memory. Anyone accessing your
computer after you have logged in with your master password can thus find your
usernames, passwords. You are hereby warned.

TODO:
  * Present errors in a nice way
  
Getting Started
---------------
* Install the extension.
* You should now see a headphone icon beside the wrench, with a yellow banner 
  indicating that you have not "logged in". Click on it and enter a master password
  that will be used to protect your credentials.
* Click on the headphones again and select "Configure SupportNotifications". 
  This will bring up the options page.
* Fill in your authentication details, as well as your master password and save your
  settings.
* You can also test your authentication details bly clicking on the "Test" button.
* A desktop notification will appear as new tickets are created, and you will be able
  to see the number of tickets, as well as the most recent ticket, by clicking on the
  headphones.

Note for Zendesk users
----------------------
You can help SupportNotifications by creating a view with "SupportNotifications"
in the title. Configure it like this:
"Meet all of the following conditions": Status less than Pending
"Order by": Request date  
"Available for": All agents

SupportNotifications will use this view when looking for new tickets.
