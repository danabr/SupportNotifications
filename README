Security considerations
------------------------
SupportNotifications uses a master password to encrypt your data on disk.
However, after you have logged in with the master password, all credentials
are available in clear text in the extensions memory. Anyone accessing your
computer after you have logged in with your master password can thus find your
usernames, passwords. You are hereby warned.

TODO:
  * Find a suitable sound for notifications
  * Make the extension pages pleasing to the eye
  * Add getsatisfaction support
  * Present errors in a nice way
